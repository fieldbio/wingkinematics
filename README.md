original files, used for spinner paper

=======
Wingkinematics_v5.0 uses the wrong degrees of freedom for standard deviation calculations (0 vs 1). However this doesn't affect any of the data presented in the Spin Paper because the only standard deviations that were used were calculated in a spreadsheet. This applies to the Standard errors used in images 3 and 8, they are correct. This ddof problem was fixed in v5.3 which is used for the geese and the sideslip.
