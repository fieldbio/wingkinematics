Current goose files. Made to work with only the left wing. The filter is made to use Left shoulder, wrist, wing, secondary, root, head and tail. Upsample script does not rotate the bird and still calculates the stroke transitions in the same way- based on the maximum wingtip excursion (position) in the strokeplane. The STD problems from earlier were corrected in version 5.3 of wingkinematics and 1.1 of upsample. Finally, the angle of attack at mid-downstroke (mid downstroke is defined as halfway between the stroke by time) is calculated based on the wingtip to root angle.
