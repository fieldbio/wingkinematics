For the flow data I used the wingkinematics from 4 hovering trials from the sideslip dataset. In addition I digitized the Right and Left wing root for those files (the raw 3d points are found in the raw_root_data folder). These points were filtered with the wingkinematics_filter_root.py script, although I'm not positive what filterfactors were used. The filtered root points were appended to the last 6 columns of the original kinematics xyz point files. Those files were then run with the wingkinematics_v5.1-root.py script, which outputs fewer files than the original kinematics, and focuses mainly on the averaged coordinates of the wings and certain per wingbeat calculations. The data is not upsampled before processing.

Figure 4 was made by creating a csv file of the average of the WingbeatAverage_kinematics_filt files and running it with the script flow-vis-kinematics-figure4.py. This generates the Dev1.svg with downstrokes and upstrokes as well as coordinates for the vortex ring. Note that the coordinates for the vortex rings do not scale the ring for upstroke and downstroke percentage, although the Dev.svg image does. This doesn't matter too much for the paper because the downstroke/upstroke percentage was 48/52 and so the small difference gets swamped out when the rings are drawn in google-sketchup.
